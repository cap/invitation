### Things to Do in Boise

We are thrilled to welcome so many friends to Idaho, many of whom are first time visitors. Boise is the town where
Eric grew up and the place Kelsey wastes the most time on Zillow. There's a ton of fun stuff to do in and around Boise - 
[we promise](http://www.seattletimes.com/life/travel/urban-hip-boise-defies-potato-jokes-and-other-idaho-stereotypes/).
Listed below are some of our recommendations.

#### [The World Center for Birds of Prey](http://www.peregrinefund.org/vmic)  
The World Center for Birds of Prey is one of our favorite places in all of Boise. Located ~10 miles outside of downtown, the 
center is home to an incredible assortment of eagles, owls, vultures, hawks, and falcons. 


#### [Hiking](http://www.ridgetorivers.org/)  
The Boise foothills have have a variety of hiking trails. Camel's Back Trail (starting at the base of Camel's Back Park 
in the North End) is a nice, easy-to-moderate trail. You can also hike up to [Table Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Rock_(Ada_County,_Idaho)) 
from the base at the Old Penitentiary parking lot if you're feeling a bit ambitious!


#### [Boise Zoo](http://zooboise.org/)  
Boise has a lovely zoo where you can feed goats and meet [capybaras](http://www.zooborns.com/.a/6a010535647bf3970b01a3fd3d706c970b-800wi)!


#### [The North End](https://northend.org/)  
Boise's North End is a historic district with many parks, shops and restaurants. In addition to walking around the beautiful
tree-lined streets of Hyde Park (the heart of the North End), we recommend coffee at Hyde Perk Cafe or Java, beer at Sun Ray Cafe, and most importantly, ice cream at Goody's Goodies.
