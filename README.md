# Eric & Kelsey Wedding 2017!

Boise, Idaho

***

We’re getting married and we hope you’ll join us for a fun weekend in Boise, Idaho!

We know that some of you will have to come a very long way to make it and we’re so grateful to all of you for taking time out to celebrate with us. It means the world to have you there.

Boise in May will hopefully have beautiful weather, but it can be somewhat unpredictable (hot, cold, rainy, sunny!). Our ceremony will be under a covered outdoor pavillion and our reception inside. We encourage you to check the weather before you pack and dress accordingly!

On this site you’ll be able to find information on the weekend schedule, lodging, and recommendations of things to do and places to eat. 

If you have any questions, please email us at ericandkelseywedding@gmail.com. We’re so excited to see you in May!

All our love,

Eric & Kelsey
